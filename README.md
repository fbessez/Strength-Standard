Purpose: This program scrapes data from strengthlevel.com
         and organizes it in such a way that allows a user
         to compare the user's current weight lifting PRs
         with others'. I use an HTMLTableParser built by a
         kind schmijos on github (https://github.com/schmijos/html-table-parser-python3)
